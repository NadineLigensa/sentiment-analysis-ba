16,"I'm working at Hawaii for Uber ! I always drive late at night. But the night is always full of unstable factors.

As soon as I got out of the car, I called the police and left the perpetrator behind. Passenger waiting to board and report to Uber that I am having an altercation with a third party. Later, the passenger canceled the ride, and Uber's security team called me, asked me to provide what happened, and permanently deactivated my account. I don't think it's my fault. In fact, I've been working at Uber for a year now. My rating is consistently above 4.97 and I drive over 4000 trips in a year.

I was waiting for Uber with 3 kids all under 10, one being just 1 year old and as I was about to open the door of the Uber car to get in and my 9 year old did the same the Uber driver drove off. I had my 1 year old on the other hand. My kids and I could have seriously got hurt and my 9 year old is now scared to get in any Uber cars. When I made a complaint they took the matter very lightly and all I was told was they are dealing with the incident and closed the case. The customer service line is bad too. It’s like you’re talking to a machine and they keep repeating the same thing! I am very disappointed at their service. If this happened it could happen to anyone else with kids. @uber",False,None,CwfuVNRgDMv,3

514,"I always drive late at night. But the night is always full of unstable factors. It was just before two o'clock in the morning when I got a pick-up request outside a bar. When I got to the gate, a third person came up and kicked my car and insulted me. As soon as I got out of the car, I called the police and left the perpetrator behind. Passenger waiting to board and report to Uber that I am having an altercation with a third party. Later, the passenger canceled the ride, and Uber's security team called me, asked me to provide what happened, and permanently deactivated my account. I don't think it's my fault. In fact, I've been working at Uber for a year now. My rating is consistently above 4.97 and I drive over 4000 trips in a year. Uber deactivated my account, no one really knew what was going on, and the customer reported me to Uber without even getting in the car. At this point, I lost my means of earning a living just because I met a madman on the road",False,None,Cu2NpPtrwLW,22
