We have never flown other than economy in our lives but I pushed him to spend the unbelievable amount of money on business class tickets so he could be comfortable. Did not know I would not be with him on one part of this trip. I have not filed any claims for every single flight being delayed or canceled, just for the difference between business class and economy on one leg.

We are very much in love (and also both have fear of flying) so we dreaded the idea of 13h without eachother’s support. She saved our trip, and even gave us a glass of champagne to toast for our engagement 😭♥️ Such a kind gesture that we will never forget! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

And then they told me there was an embargo from the country I wss flying to and pets were not allowed on commercial flights. As you may imagine this created a very stressful situation, imagine being told the country you moving to are not allowing pets to enter. Turns out I contact the country (Ireland) and this information is totally false. There is no embargo, is a company decision. So they gave me wrong information, made me waste money and time on calls, nights without sleep because of wrong information. When I asked for a refund was denied cause ""it was not their fault"".

Finally, the arrangement would be to pick up here in Cappadocia, where I arrived at 12:30 pm. They asked me to wait because between 14:30/15:30 the suitcase would finally be delivered to me. Absurdly, they said that if it wasn't like that, they would only deliver me to the hotel after 2, 3 days. Detail, I won't even be here anymore, the stay in Cappadocia is short. It's almost 4:30 pm. On the planes that arrived from Istanbul, none of my luggage. I had to separate from the group with me. I will have to pay for another airport-hotel transfer, because I missed the one scheduled.
