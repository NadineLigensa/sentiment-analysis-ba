This fire season in Canada is the worst on record and it is still June. Quebec and nothern Ontario also have had lower spring precipitation levels and less and less snow on average. Global warming is climate change, the overall global temperature has risen which impacts the jet stream and weather patterns, and caused more frequent storms extreme weather. This means it can be lower than average temperatures in some places but the precipitation can still be lower and that has cumulative impacts. The climate is a global system and it’s about long term trends.
